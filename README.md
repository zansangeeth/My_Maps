# MyMaps Android App

An Android app demonstrating how to use the Google Maps API. See the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7NYbSE8uaBCSkZum6Z88RvjiXrTBpjT2) to learn how to build this.

This app displays a map showing markers of important places. You can also create a map which gets saved to a file and can be retrieved when the app is opened. 

This app helps you keep track of places that matter to you, whether they’re vacation ideas or places you’ve lived. It's a simpler version of this app the [My Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.m4b) app by Google.
